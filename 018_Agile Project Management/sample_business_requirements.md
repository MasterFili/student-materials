## Business Objectives

The value this project brings to individuals lies in it's purpose, and the main purpose of the application is to fufill the goals of the user. The completion of the users goals is what will determine how valuable the application is. what one wants to accomplish in either health (dieting (calorie calculator, nutrient tracker, weight loss/gain expectaional progress etc), exercise (workout index**, cardio tracking, calorie burn, progress reports**, etc) etc..), finances ( stock/crypto portofolio, budgeting, savings goals (conect to bank account), income projections, monthly/yearly expenses, rainy day vault etc.) and lifestyle (health, finances, & general goal tracking, time managment (agenda), reminders**, etc) although most features will not be implemented immedietly, the general objective is to create a platform that helps align the users wants in a systematic tool-like structure. freemium modeled application that allows user access to a limited amount of features, and grants access to all features with one-time payment, or subscription service( still undecided at this point).
